# Predicting Distracted Drivers  

## Overview  


The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimated that in 2018, driver distraction was a factor in about 8 percent of all fatal crashes and 15 percent of all injury crashes. Every day about 8 people were killed and more than 1000 injured in crashes that involved a distracted driver. These estimates may be low as it is challenging to determine distraction in driver fatality crashes, and self-reported distractions are likely underreported. 

Distractions include any activity that takes your attention away from driving and fall in three main categories: 
•	visual: looking at something not related to driving;  
•	manual: taking your hands off the steering wheel; and  
•	cognitive: taking your mind off driving.  

Systems that detect distractions and report them to drivers in real-time could reduce distracted driving accidents and deaths.   

This project aims to identify driver distractions from dashboard camera images.
